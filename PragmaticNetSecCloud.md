Title: Pragmatic Network Security for Cloud and Hybrid Networks
by Rich Mogull

# The challenge of cloud computing and network security 





Software defined networks are fundamentally different
Loss of traditional visibility
New ways of managing networks
Constant state of change
The role of hybrid 
Bridging corporate networks to the cloud
Even with the cloud, you often connect different networks
Cloud Networking 101 
Types of cloud networks 
Full SDN (e.g. AWS) 
How it works
Differences from physical networks
VLAN-based (e.g. Softlayer)
Defining and managing cloud networks 
APIs
Architectures 
Public
Private
Internet gateways/connectivity
Internal gateways/connectivity
VPNs
Regions and availability zones
Hybrid cloud architectures 
Why hybrid
VPN-based
Direct network connections
Routing challenges
Impact of auto scaling and static routing challenges
Impact of cloud availability architectures
Monitoring challenges
Network Security Controls (pros and cons specified for each) 
What providers give you 
Perimeter security (what you don’t see)
Security groups
ACLs
Commercial add-ons 
Physical
Virtual appliances
Monitoring/logging 
Most providers do not offer
Varies tremendously
Additional options 
Virtual appliances
Host Security
Building your cloud network security program
Key considerations 
Provider-specific limitations or advantages
Application needs
“New” architectures
PaaS/IaaS mix
Elasticity and rate of change
Managing and monitoring
Designing the architecture
Accounts
Regions
Availability zones
VPCs (or equivalent, need to see what other providers call it)
Public/private
Internet and enterprise connections
VPNs
Direct connect
Security implications
Designing the network security architecture
Which tools to use when
Building your management plane
Integrating PaaS
Managing cloud (and hybrid) security operations
Organizing and staffing
Discovery
Policy enforcement
Integrating with dev
Normalizing on-prem and cloud
Translating rules
Normalizing operations
Accounting for architectural differences
Automation and immutable network security
Design Patterns
Pure public cloud application
Public only or public/private network
Hybrid/public facing application
Hybrid/internal-apps
Emerging architectures
